- Basic Python syntax and data types
- Functions and classes
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Object-oriented programming
- Game development concepts

### Projects
1. **Tic-tac-toe Game**
   - Command-line version (`tic_tac_toe.py`)
   - Graphical user interface version (`tic_tac_toe_gui.py`)
   - Demonstrates GUI programming with Tkinter

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Minecraft Pi API or Minecraft with Pi mod
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Setup Instructions
